## misc
Miscellaneous more or less handy stuff.

## torx
- torx/CheckExit.py: collect tls certificates through tor (sometimes there are MitM attempts at exits and it's widely considered a good idea to document and [report](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays) these). You might also be interested in other people's tools such as [exitmap](https://github.com/NullHypothesis/exitmap).

## trackography
Unique identifiers considered harmful.
- yourprobes/tea.py: a very simple script that reads probed ESSIDs aloud using text-to-speech. use case: get clueless users to acknowledge the dangers posed by excessive chattiness of their WIFI devices.

## emacs
Highlighting iptables rules.
